# Burger Handlebars

## This application logs a user's burger order. Once the burger has been eaten, the user clicks on the undevoured burger, which well then move under the devoured column.

## This application uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom made ORM to log the burger orders! I usde Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
